# Using Hackvertor tags

Hackvertor is a free open source tool I wrote for Burp Suite. I've crafted some Hackvertor tags to help generate unicode overflows and encoded word attacks easily from within Burp. I've created multiple tags to help you construct the attacks mentioned in my talk.

# Install Hackvertor

You can install Hackvertor from the BApp store:

All tags can be installed from the tag store
