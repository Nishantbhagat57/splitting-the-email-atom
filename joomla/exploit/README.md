# Joomla exploit

This directory contains all the code for the Joomla exploit. The fake-chat application is just some HTML that fakes a chat window to simulate an admin getting a message that links to CSRF exploit. The directory contains two CSRF attacks "create-backdoor.html" which writes to an admin template and "make-super-admin-enable.html" which enables you to perform a CSRF that enables an attackers account and make it super admin. The directory also contains a copy of the CSS exfiltrator that enables you to steal the token and serve the CSRF exploit.
