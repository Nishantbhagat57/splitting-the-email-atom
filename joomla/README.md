# Joomla docker

For your convenience I've created a docker file with the vulnerable version of Joomla.

1. cd to this directory
2. docker compose up --detach
3. Visit: localhost:8000 to configure Joomla
4. Setup Joomla to allow user registrations: System->Global Configuration->Users->Allow User Registrations
